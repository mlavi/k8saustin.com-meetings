# F&B: Food and Beverage Planning

## Overview
During monthly planning, we nominate an organizer to handle F&B for the meeting. In 2025, a typical meeting has 30 people attend, although we've seen higher turnout in the North Austin venue.

The F&B organizer is responsible for:
    - Day before:
      - Order and pay vendors
      - Arrange delivery instructions and security/facility clearance if needed
    - Delivery before meeting start:
      - Confirming order status, delivery
      - F&B layout on tables with ice chest(s), napkins, cuttlery, and plates
    - Meeting end: coordinating cleanup of garbage and leftovers

Budget:
    - When possible, we search for sponsors to cover the cost of F&B with a budget is $200/meeting.
    - Otherwise, the organizer pays out of pocket and submits expense receipts for remibursement from the organization.
